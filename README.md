Online Retail  Segmentation
MetaData:
 Look for a dataset that contains information about customers such as demographic information, purchasing history, and customer interactions. The data set contains the following variables:
InvoiceNo: The invoice number for each transaction
StockCode: The unique code for each product sold
Description: The description of each product sold
Quantity: The quantity of each product sold in each transaction
InvoiceDate: The date and time of each transaction
UnitPrice: The price of each product sold
CustomerID: The unique identifier for each customer
Country: The country where each transaction occurred
SQL Project Idea: Use SQL queries to answer the following questions:

Beginner Queries.
•	Define meta data in mysql workbench
•	What is the distribution of order values across all customers in the dataset?
•	How many unique products has each customer purchased?
•	Which customers have only made a single purchase from the company?
•	Which products are most commonly purchased together by customers in the dataset?

Advance Queries 
1.	Customer Segmentation by Purchase Frequency
Group customers into segments based on their purchase frequency, such as high, medium, and low frequency customers. This can help you identify your most loyal customers and those who need more attention.
2. Average Order Value by Country
Calculate the average order value for each country to identify where your most valuable customers are located.
3. Customer Churn Analysis
 Identify customers who haven't made a purchase in a specific period (e.g., last 6 months) to assess churn.
4. Product Affinity Analysis
Determine which products are often purchased together by calculating the correlation between product purchases.
5. Time-based Analysis
  Explore trends in customer behavior over time, such as monthly or quarterly sales patterns.
